# Higgs analysis with CSV

## Structure of the data 
In each csv file there are px, py, pz and energy of the four relevant leptons stored (in total 16 fields).
the leptons are listed after each other, the first entry of each cell is px of the first lepton, the second entry is py of the first lepton and the 16th entry is the energy of the fourth lepton. The 17th entry contains the event weight (for data exactly 1). Each row of the csv file represents one event.
